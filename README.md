# Crystal Collector

This is a simple jQuery game that displays four crystals on the page. Each Crystal is assigned a random value which is hidden from the end-user. When the end-user clicks the crystal, the score increases by the amount that the crystal is worth. The object of the game, is to get your score equal to that of the target score, which is randomly generated from the beginning of the game.
